           <h3><p>Hello! My name is Carmen. I live in Okaland. I have two little siters, Im the oldest. Im also latina! 
           My favorite subjects are history and computer science. At first in middle school everyone said that history was not important and "just a wast of time," but I always liked history. When I was six years old I always wanted where the mommies came from and how they came to life. </p>
            <p>I like to listen to music, read, draw, sleep, be with friends and sisters. MY family dont go out much so I like to watch dramas, Youtube, and anime. </p>
            <p>My favorite group is Bangtan. One reason I like them is because they are talented (I don't care about looks but looks do matter in the industry so I praise their natural looks) and Yes I think they pave the way. Another reason why I like them is they do donation for the people that need it. They had a Collaborates with UNICEF on 'Love Myself' Anti-Violence Campaign and for the two years rais $500 million. Sadly that campaign ended in April 2019 but till today Bangtan still donate. Example, one of the members birthday, Namjoon pass on September 12 and to celebrate his birth day on an article it said, "On September 20, the Seoul Samsung School—a specialized school for the hearing-impaired—announced that RM had made a generous donation of 100 million won (approximately $83,794) to the school for his birthday. The school also revealed that RM had requested that his donation be used for music education." Another reason why I like them is because they talk about health issues and loving yourself a lot in their song, example; one of their famouse solo song, sang by the member Jin, 'Epiphany ' is a beautiful solo about loving yourself, "I'm the one I should love in this world
            Shining me, precious soul of mine
            I finally realized so I love me
            Not so perfect but so beautiful
            I’m the one I should love...I’m shaking and afraid but I keep going forward
            I’m meeting the real you, hidden in the storm
            Why did I want to hide my precious self like this?
            What was I so afraid of?
            Why did I hide my true self?" I have many reasons why Bangtan is my most favorite groups but these are why I admire their work.
